# Amazon-Ad-Click-Prediction
•	This project focuses on predicting whether a user will click on an online advertisement using machine learning. By analyzing user demographics, browsing behavior, device type, ad position, and time of day, a binary classification model was trained to identify patterns in user engagement. The model helps improve ad targeting and optimize marketing strategies for better click-through rates.
## Aim
•	To develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement based on their demographic information, browsing behavior, and the contextual display of the ad.
## Solution Approach
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
